## Getting started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- git
### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:actuallyyun/frontend-project.git
```
2. Install dependencies

```

To run test, use the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Overview

This project adopts a [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) approach, so you could find the first basic elements:

### UI layer
- **Components**: This folder contains the basic UI elements. You should add any UI element inside this folder, with it's logic and the respective CSS file module(if needed).Each component resides next to its data flow logic, and it's test file.

- **Pages**: This folder contains the main pages of the application. Each page should have its own folder.

### Service layer
This is the layer that communicates the application with the outer world, and the one that would be coupled with almost any 3rd party provider, framework, etc. In this case, the service layer is implemented with RTK Query, which is a powerful data fetching and caching tool.

### `misc` folder
type, utility functions, and other miscellaneous files are stored here.

### `test` folder
Reusable test utilities and custom render functions are stored here.

## Data flow

### User auth data flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD

    A[Account] -->B{Is logged? }
    B -->|Yes| C(Profile page)
    B -->|No| D(Auth page)
    D -->|has account|E(login)
    D-->|no account|F(register)
    D-->|other|G(login with google)
    G-->H
    F-->|redirected|D
    E-->H(Save auth token,user info to redux store)
    H-->|reload|I(retrieve auth token from localstorage and set user redux store state)
    I-->|login user successfully|J(user is true and logged in)
    J-->B
    I-->|login user failed|K(send a refresh token request)
    K-->|refresh successfully|L(save new credentials)
    L-->I
    K-->|refresh failed|M(set user and token to null, isloggedin to false)

```

### useContext theme data flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD

    A[App loads] --> |on render|B(retrieve data from local storage)
    A-->|on user click|D(set to the non-current value)
    B --> |is data|C(set theme to data in storage)
    B-->|no data|C(set theme to default-light)
    D-->B(save data to local storage)
```

## Component structure

```mermaid

    Main Components <|-- Category
    Main Components <|-- Product
    Main Components <|-- Cart
    Main Components <|-- User

    class Category{
      -categoryList:list view, shown on nav
      -categoryCard:card view, shown on home page
      -sortByPrice:shown on category page
    }
    class Product{
      -productCard:single product card, shown on category, and all products page
      -searchProduct:shown on all products page
      -createProductForm:shown on admin profile page
      -updateProductForm:shown to admin on single product page
    }
    class User{
     -userRegisterForm:shown on auth page
     -userLoginForm:shown on auth page, can toggle with register userLoginForm
     -LoginWithGoogle:shown on auth page
    }

```

### Pages Overview

- Home `./`
- Auth `./auth`
- Profile `./account` **Private route**. Only logged in users can access this page.
- Cart `./cart`
- Single product page `./product/:id`
- Category page `./shop/id`
- All products page `./product`


### Testing
The project uses `react testing library` and `jest` for unit testing. 

To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash 
yarn test
```
1. Unit testing for RTK queries

![RTK Query tests](./public/rtkquery%20test.png)
*auth and product api tests 91-92% coverage*

2. Unite testing for reducers

![User Reducer tests](./public/userReducer%20test.png)
*User reducer tests 89.65% coverage*

![Cart and Category Slice tests](./public/categorytest.png)
*Cart and category slice tests - 100% test coverage*

3. Unit testing for utility functions

![Utility functions tests](./public/util%20testing.png)

*Utility functions tests-90% test coverage*

4. Unit testing for components

*Key logic in components are tested*

## Deployment
The project is deployed on Vercel. The deployment is automated, so any push to the main branch will trigger a new deployment.
Remember to set the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.Do not add quotation marks to the values.
